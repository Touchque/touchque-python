# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to `touchque-authenticator` (Python).

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev,flask,django,fastapi]"
```

## Running tests

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest
```

Some suites run **contract tests** against `testing/fake-touchque-api.mjs` — a
small, dependency-free Node server that verifies the SDK's HMAC request
signatures exactly like the real API does. These need `node` on `PATH`; they
skip themselves otherwise.

## Making a change

1. If it touches the wire protocol or the step-up contract, update the
   fixtures in `fixtures/` and the fake API in `testing/` first.
2. Add tests. A behavior change without a test won't be merged.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format) under `## [Unreleased]`.
4. Keep code, comments, docs and error messages in English.
5. Don't add a dependency to the SDK's core (only `touchque.contrib.*`
   adapters may depend on a web framework, and only as an optional extra).

## Pull requests

- Describe what changed and why, not just what. If it's a breaking change,
  say so explicitly and explain the migration.
- CI must pass.
